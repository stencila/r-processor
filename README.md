## Install

Rasta is available as a R package. It isn't on CRAN yet, but you can install it from this repository using the [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package,

```r
remotes::install_github("stencila/rasta")
```

## Use

Register Rasta so that it can be discovered by other executors on your machine,

```r
rasta::register()
```

If you have [`executa`](https://github.com/stencila/executa) installed globally, you can then run Rasta using the `execute` command and specifying `r` as the starting language,

```bash
executa execute --repl --lang r
```

## Develop

Get started by cloning this repository,

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stencila/rasta
cd rasta
```

Most development tasks can be run from R, using `make` shortcuts, or RStudio keyboard shortcuts.

### Testing

Unit tests live in the `tests` folder. Most of the tests are written using the `testthat` package. When writing regression tests for a specific issues, please name the test file accordingly e.g. `tests/testthat/test-issue-1.R`. There is also a `tests/cpp` folder for C++ tests and a `tests/bench` folder for benchmarking.

### Documentation

Documentation is written using `roxygen2` and the documentation site is generated by `pkgdown` into the [`docs`](docs) folder and published on Github pages.

### Continuous integration

Tests are run on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/stencila/rasta) and code coverage tracked at [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/stencila/rasta).
